<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>
<img class="col2" src="{{site.baseurl }}/resources/photo.jpg">
I am currently an Assistant Professor in <a href="http://www.cs.memphis.edu">Computer Science</a>
 at the <a href="http://www.memphis.edu">University of
Memphis</a>. I attended graduate school at the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu">University of Virginia</a> where I received my doctorate in <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu">Computer Science</a> and attended the <a href="http://www.louisville.edu">University of Louisville</a> where I
received bachelor and master degrees in <a href="http://www.cs.louisville.edu/">Computer Engineering and Computer
Science</a>.</p>

<h1> Research </h1>

<p>My research interests cover several areas of the construction and evaluation of
distributed systems including: compilers, programming languages, networking, and
wireless sensor networks. The core theme of my research seeks to harness the
potential of distributed systems to affect and interact with the physical world.</p>
<br>

<h1> Notable projects </h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>MacroLab provides a vector programming abstraction similar to Matlab which can
    be used to automatically optimize various aspects of a wireless sensor network.</li><br>

    <li>An energy efficient Smart Home applies sensing and control mechanisms to reduce
    the energy consumption of a home without negatively affecting the occupants. The
    core of my dissertation focuses on identifying and tracking individuals within
    the home environment without requiring wearable or video tracking devices.
